        Functions    in JavaScript’s
Functions are like recipes. They can execute a set of instructions on data or variables and return the result. The beauty of functions is that they are recyclable. 
That is, the function can be used repeatedly without having to write the same code again.

Methods
A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not. Let’s explore some of JavaScript’s built-in methods.


Function	in Java
Functions have independent existence. You can define them outside of the class.
Functions don't have any reference variables.

Methods 
methodsdo not have independent existence. They are always defined within a class, struct, or enum.
	Methods are called using reference variables.

                
        Express is a fast, assertive, essential and moderate web framework of Node.js.
         You can assume express as a layer built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage a server and routes. 
        It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.\\
